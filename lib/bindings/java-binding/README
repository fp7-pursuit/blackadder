The Blackadder Java binding has been tested with Java 6. It has been built
using the OpenJDK JVM. Compatibility with other Java VMs is uncertain.

First, make sure that you build the C code in the jni folder. There is a
README file there for instructions.

This directory is an Eclipse project folder, so you can directly import it
to the Eclipse IDE. If you prefer to compile it manually, there is an ant
script file available. Make sure that ant is installed. In case ant is
missing, just run:

sudo apt-get install ant

You also need to have a JAR file for Apache Commons Codec in your lib
subdirectory. See ./lib/install.txt for further instructions.

To compile the Java code, run ant.

In order to produce a Blackadder JAR file, run:

ant dist

For examples of using the Java binding with Blackadder, see example code in
the test directory.
